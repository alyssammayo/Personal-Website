Notes From W3Schools


Links:
HTML Links - The Target Attribute
By default, the linked paged will be displayed in the current browser window. To change this, 
you must specify another target for the link.

The target attribute specfies where to open the linked document

The target attribute can have one of the following values:
_self       - Default. Opens the doc in the same window/tab as it was clicked
_blank      - Opens the doc in a new window of tab
_parent     - Opens the doc in the parent frame
_top        - Opens the doc in the full body of the window

Use an Image as a Linke:
To use an image as a link, just put the <img> tag inside the <a> tag
Example:
<a href="Link">
    <img src="" alt="Image" style="width:20px; height:25px;">
</a>

Link to an Email Address
Use mailto: inside the href attribute to create a link that opens the user's email program (to let them send a new email):
Example:
<a href="mailto:someone@example.com">Send email</a>

Button as a Link
To use an HTML button as a link, you have to add some JavaScript code.
JavaScript allows you to specify what happens at certain events, such as a click of a button:
Example:
<button onclick="document.location='doc.asp' ">Title</button>

Link Titles
The title attribute specifies extra information about an element. 
The information is most often shown as a tooltp text when the mouse over the element.
Example:
<a href="Link" title="Link Example"> Visit The Link Example </a>

Link Buttons
A link can also be styled as a button, by using CSS:
Example:
<style>
    a:link, a:visted {
        background-color: #f44336;
        color: white;
        padding: 15px 25px;
        text-align: center;
        text-decoration: none;
        display: inline-block
    }

    a:hover, a:active {
        background-color: red;
    }
</style>





Color Stuff:

An RGBA color value is specfied with:
rgba (red, green, blue, alpha)

For Transparent Backgrounds. Notice how the last number has values of 0 to 1.
Try One of The Following:
background-color:rgba(255, 0, 0);
rgba(255, 99, 71, 0.2);
rgba(255, 99, 71, 0.4);
rgba(255, 99, 71, 0.6);
rgba(255, 99, 71, 0.8);
rgba(255, 99, 71, 1);



HEX Color Values:
#rrggbb
rr = red, gg = green, bb = blue
between 00 and ff
#ff000 = red, #00ff00 = green, #0000ff = blue
#000000 = black, #ffffff = white



HSL Color Values:
hsl (hue, saturation, lightness)
Hue is a degree on the color wheel from 0 to 360. Where 0 is red, 120 is green, and 240 is blue.
Saturation is a percentage value. 0% means a shade of gray, and 100% is the full color.
Lightness is also a percentage value. 0% is black, and 100% is white.

Saturation:
Can be described as the intensity of a color
100% is pure color, no shades of gray.
50% is 50% gray, but you can still see the color.
0% is completely gray; you can no longer see the color.

Lightness:
Can be described as how much light you want to give the color, where: 
0% = no light (black), 50% = 50% light (neighter dark or light), 100% = full lightness (white)
Examples:
hsl(0, 100%, 0%);
hsl(0, 100%, 25%);
hsl(0, 100%, 50%);
hsl(0, 100%, 75%);
hsl(0, 100%, 90%);
hsl(0, 100%, 100%);

Shades of Gray
Are often defined by setting the hue and saturation to 0, and adjusting the lightness from 0% to 100% to get darker/lighter shades:
hsl(0, 0%, 20%);
hsl(0, 0%, 30%);
hsl(0, 0%, 40%);
hsl(0, 0%, 60%);
hsl(0, 0%, 70%);
hsl(0, 0%, 90%);


HSLA Color Values
Are an extension of HSL color values, with an Aplha channel - which specifies the opacity for a color

An HSLA color value is specified with:
hsla(hue, saturation, lightness, alpha)
The alpha parameter is a number between 0.0 (fully transparent) and 1.0 (not transpararent at all)
Example:
hsla(9, 100%, 64%, 0);
hsla(9, 100%, 64%, 0.2);
hsla(9, 100%, 64%, 0.4);
hsla(9, 100%, 64%, 0.6);
hsla(9, 100%, 64%, 0.8);
hsla(9, 100%, 64%, 1);

Cool combo:
hsla(223, 100%, 11%, 0.8);
hsla(202, 50%, 48%, 0.8);
